## backend communication patterns:

Backend communication patterns define how different parts of a backend system (or multiple systems/services) communicate with each other. Choosing the right pattern depends on the use case, scalability, latency, and complexity needs.

### 🧩 1. Request-Response

- Pattern: Client sends a request → waits for a response.
- Example: HTTP APIs (GET /users/1)
- Use Case: Synchronous operations where the client needs a result.
- Pros: Simple and widely supported.
- Cons: Blocking, higher latency under load.

### 🔔 2. Push Notifications

- Pattern: Server pushes data to the client without a new request.
- Example: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), APNs.
- Use Case: Alerts, messages, or updates.
- Pros: Real-time updates, low bandwidth.
- Cons: Requires persistent connection or third-party service.

### 🔁 3. Short Polling

- Pattern: Client periodically asks the server: “Is there new data?”
- Example: setInterval(fetchData, 5000)
- Use Case: Simulate real-time updates without WebSockets.
- Pros: Simple to implement.
- Cons: Wastes resources if data doesn't change often.

### 🔄 4. Long Polling

- Pattern: Client sends a request; server holds it open until data is ready.
- Example: Chat apps before WebSockets were common.
- Use Case: Near real-time communication without WebSockets.
- Pros: More efficient than short polling.
- Cons: Complex to manage connections.

### 🌐 5. Server-Sent Events (SSE)

- Pattern: One-way stream from server to client using HTTP.
- Example: Real-time dashboard updates.
- Use Case: Monitoring, notifications, or log streaming.
- Pros: Simple, lightweight, built into HTTP.
- Cons: One-way only (server → client), not supported in all clients.

### 🔊 6. Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)

- Pattern: Services publish messages to topics; subscribers receive relevant messages.
- Example: Kafka, Redis Pub/Sub, Google Pub/Sub.
- Use Case: Event-driven microservices, decoupled systems.
- Pros: Decouples producers from consumers.
- Cons: Message ordering and reliability can be tricky.

### 🧱 7. Sidecar Pattern

- Pattern: An auxiliary service runs alongside the main app in the same container/pod.
- Example: Service mesh proxies (like Envoy), logging agents, auth sidecars.
- Use Case: Add features like logging, security, observability.
- Pros: Modular, reusable, isolated.
- Cons: More containers to manage; operational complexity.

### 🔗 Summary Table

| Pattern            | Direction        | Real-time? | Coupling | Use Case                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Request-Response   | Bi-directional   | No         | Tight    | APIs, standard client-server |
| Push Notifications | Server → Client  | Yes        | Loose    | Alerts, mobile messages      |
| Short Polling      | Client → Server  | Almost     | Tight    | Quick workaround for updates |
| Long Polling       | Client → Server  | Yes        | Tight    | Chat, notifications          |
| Server-Sent Events | Server → Client  | Yes        | Loose    | Dashboards, updates          |
| Publish/Subscribe  | Any              | Yes        | Loose    | Event-driven apps            |
| Sidecar            | Internal Service | -          | Modular  | Observability, logging, auth |

## Examples

### ✅ 1. Request-Response (HTTP)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello from server!")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/hello", helloHandler)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

Test:  
`curl http://localhost:8080/hello`

### ✅ 2. Push Notifications (via Webhook)

### ✅ 3. Short Polling

### ✅ 4. Long Polling

### ✅ 5. Server-Sent Events (SSE)

### ✅ 6. Publish/Subscribe (using Redis Pub/Sub)

### ✅ 7. Sidecar Pattern (gRPC Proxy Example)
